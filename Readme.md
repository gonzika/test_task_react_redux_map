## Tasks
1. Clone repository
1. Install dependencies, run dev server
1. Fix potential errors during start
1. Implement login method to `/users/login`
    - request body should have form:
    ```
    {
      "username": "username",
      "password": "password"
    }
    ```

1. Get data from `/areas/data` using token uthorization and render on map in `Data` component using scatterplot method  
    - `/login` endpoint should return token, which should be next passed in header in form:  
    ```
    Authorization: Token token_string
    ```

    - similiar effect should be achieved:

## Additional remarks
- commits should be done after every particular change, names should be self-explanatory
- it's possible to use additional libraries in order to complete tasks
